# SODa_WissKI-ISWC25Bits

## Detailed Description


The tutorial offers a step-by-step, interactive introduction to semantic modeling and data curation using WissKI (Wissenschaftliche Kommunikations-Infrastruktur)
[1], an open-source, web-based environment for the collaborative creation and publication of scientific collections. WissKI extends Drupal [2] with semantic
technologies, including RDF-based data storage and provides access through a SPARQL endpoint. With the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM)
[3] it enables its users to build upon one of the central standards for cultural heritage in their specific system.


As part of the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI e.V.) [4], WissKI supports the sustainable, open, and persistent accessibility of cultural and
research collections [5]. It plays a central role in the development of interoperable collection infrastructures across disciplines. The data literacy project SODa [6]
contributes to this mission by offering consulting formats, training programs, and self-guided tutorials for semantic object modeling, data entry, and Linked Open Data
publication with WissKI.

This tutorial follows a structured learning path based on the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) [7], which is also available in
Japanese [8]. Participants work through modular WissKI Bits, each focusing on a specific activity such as collecting, describing, annotating, or publishing. Guided by a
concrete scenario, a computer game collection, participants conceptualize and model ontologies, design semantic paths, and prepare and query FAIR-compliant RDF data.
The tutorial alternates between short inputs and independent practical exercises.

The tutorial is fully implemented in LiaScript [9], aligned with Open Educational Resource (OER) principles [10], and will be openly available via GitHub [11] and
published on Zenodo.

## Motivation

Ontology-driven data modeling and FAIR-compliant publication are central challenges in today’s Semantic Web landscape. Although numerous tools and
frameworks exist, few provide an integrated, user-oriented environment that demonstrates semantic modeling in practice, particularly when leveraging established
domain ontologies such as CIDOC CRM. WissKI addresses this gap by offering Linked Data-native workflows within a configurable, ontology-aligned system
designed for collaborative, web-based data curation. It enables researchers to manage and publish semantically structured data while maintaining interoperability and
long-term reusability.

This tutorial presents a practical, infrastructure-level application of Semantic Web standards and methods. It is especially relevant for professionals working in research
data infrastructures, LOD pipelines, semantic user interfaces, or ontology alignment projects. By offering a hands-on, modular learning format based on the TaDiRAH
taxonomy and implemented as Open Educational Resource (OER), the tutorial fosters broader adoption and critical reflection on ontology-based modeling practices.
Engaging with the ISWC community, we hope to receive constructive feedback to further develop and refine the tutorial, both as a teaching resource and as a reusable
framework for sustainable data modeling and publication.
